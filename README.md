# React Cards

React Cards is inspired by Bruce Hauman's excellent [devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) project which aims to provide ClojureScript developers with a visual REPL-like experience especially suited for UI development.

React Cards tries to bring a similar experience to React developers,
opening up the possibility to quickly test
the look and feel as well as the behavior of a component.
Furthermore enabling developers to write markdown and
even run tests against the component, displaying the test results as a React component itself.

This approach has many benefits.
A component with multiple possible states can be difficult to test and document.
With React Cards we can display the component in many different states along with documentation and tests to ensure nothing breaks while we're working on the component.
