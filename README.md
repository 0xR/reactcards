#REACT CARDS

##Introduction

React Cards is inspired by Devcards which aims to provide ClojureScript developers with a REPL-like experience.
React Card tries to bring a similar experience to React Developers. Opening up the possibility to quickly test 
the look and feel as well as the behavior of a component. Furthermore enabling developers to write markdown and 
even run tests against the component, displaying the test results as a React component itself.

This approach has many benefits. Displaying a component multiple states can be difficult to display, test and document. 
With React Cards we can display all possible states, document and even ensure no tests are breaking when creating the
component.
