# React Cards

React Cards is inspired by Bruce Hauman's excellent [devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) project which aims to provide ClojureScript developers with a visual REPL-like experience especially suited for UI development.

React Cards tries to bring a similar experience to React developers,
opening up the possibility to quickly test
the look and feel as well as the behavior of a component.
Furthermore enabling developers to write markdown and
even run tests against the component, displaying the test results as a React component itself.

This approach has many benefits.
A component with multiple possible states can be difficult to test and document.
With React Cards we can display the component in many different states along with documentation and tests to ensure nothing breaks while we're working on the component.

### Getting started

A. Clone this repository and run

```javascript 
npm install
npm start example 
```

React Cards will be available at http://localhost:8080

To see React Cards in action, go to the example directory and start experimenting with devcards.js

## Writing Cards

```javascript 
import React from 'react'
import cards from 'reactcards'
import {Foo, Bar} from './components'

const demo = cards('demo')

abc.card(<Foo message="yo" />, 'here is  a simple example')

demo.card(
  <Foo message="hello"/>, {
  doc:
  `## markdown doc
  you can use markdown for card documentation
  - foo
  - bar
  `
})

demo.card(<Foo message="hello world"/>)

demo.card(<Bar/>, {title: 'a bar card'})
```


## Writing Tests

```javascript 

// your test file... 
import {assert} from 'chai'

export function testAdd() {
  assert.equal(1 + 1, 2)
}

export function testFail() {
  assert.isTrue(false)
}

// your reactcards file
import React from 'react'
import cards from 'reactcards'
import someTests from './testFile'

const demo = cards('demo')

demo.test(someTests, {title:'simple tests'})
```

You can write tests in a separate folder or write them directly inside a card. The first enables us to reuse the test
in a different setting. More information regarding testing very soon.
